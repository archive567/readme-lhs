<p><em>a literate haskell workflow.</em></p>
<pre>
  <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
stack build --copy-bins --exec "readme" --exec "pandoc -f markdown+lhs -i readme.lhs -t html -o index.html --filter pandoc-include --mathjax" --exec "pandoc -f markdown+lhs -i readme.lhs -t markdown -o readme.md --filter pandoc-include --mathjax" --exec "echo Yah, it succeeded!" --file-watch
  </code>
</pre>
<p>The command above is a major milestone in my personal workflow and I'm <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2955">this</a> close. Once it works I can type <code>stack new project-name readme-lhs &amp;&amp; cd project-name</code>, fire up this command and start cutting code and docs in readme.lhs. On save, I get:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>an automated compilation loop for code</li>
<li>execution of a main function</li>
<li>code and comments rendered in html</li>
<li>code and comments rendered as a readme.md</li>
<li>ability to use maths formulae via mathjax</li>
<li>ability to mix code and results using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-include">pandoc-include</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A poor haskellers imitation of jupyter, sure, but until we climb the curve of tool maturity this will do me as a quick project start.</p>
<h1 id="usage">usage</h1>
<h2 id="template">template</h2>
<p>The template produces a shell project that builds out-of-the-box.</p>
<pre><code>stack new project-name readme-lhs
cd project-name
stack install
readme</code></pre>
<p>and it should chirp back a cheery &quot;ok&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="other/readme-lhs.hsfiles">template file</a> can always be edited, renamed etc and dropped into a directory, and stack will find it.</p>
<h1 id="design-wonkery">design wonkery</h1>
<p>Stripping away optional extras, readme-lhs tries for a minimalist design:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>markdown for all docs. Anything outside what markdown can do is too fancy.</li>
<li>pandoc for document conversion. <code>-f markdown+lhs</code> is a georgeous rendering of a .lhs file. I turn <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">github pages</a> on using the User Pages site method for each project I'd like to blog, and render readme.lhs to index.html using pandoc.</li>
<li>css for styling, but also dealing with github markdown style which is where many users will read your lhs.</li>
<li>using lhs as a valid haskell artform</li>
<li>readme.lhs as a general purpose executable, tester, example holder and all-round centralising communication document.</li>
<li>a long list of the most commonly-used, and mostly-benign language flags, NoImplicitPrelude &amp; UnicodeSyntax. I call this -XHaskell2016 in private.</li>
<li>the stack-recommended .travis.yml (the complictaed one, so I can keep track of busting old ghc and lts versions)</li>
<li>Embedding <a href="https://www.stackage.org/package/protolude">Protolude</a> as the replacement prelude.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I threw out:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>haddock. The design space of using markdown as a complete replacement is fresh territory.</li>
<li>test directory. I looked through my test and example directories and noted the mess in many. I love to test - creating a realistic arbitrary instance is the best way to get to know your data structures - but tests and multiple examples didn't belong in the start-up phase.</li>
<li>hakyll. For me, markdown created for a separate blogging process is better inside the actual project as readme's - my hakyll site rots pretty quickly.</li>
<li>app directory. The boundary between what the app is and what the library is is very fluid for me, and a source of technical debt as concepts bounce between directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then keep this repo around for phase 2, where a project takes a successful shape and and needs test and app boiler-plate.</p>
<h1 id="lhs-executable">lhs executable</h1>
<p>I use both .lhs and .hs styles, and often need to flip between the two. In particular, hlint didn't always play nice with .lhs, and for a while I needed to flip from .lhs to .hs, run hlint, and then flip back to .lhs.</p>
<p>lhs makes no attempt to account for haddock and will thus not be suitable for most people.</p>
<p>To install and use lhs:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tonyday567/readme-lhs
cd readme-lhs
stack install
lhs --file-in readme.lhs --file-out readme.hs</code></pre>

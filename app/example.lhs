readme-lhs
===

[Readme-lhs](https://github.com/tonyday567/readme-lhs) is an example of mixing [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and haskell code in literate style, aiming for rapid development from initial idea to rendered description. The project:

- aims for a minimal but complete startup phase for a haskell project.
- Targets [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for document conversion. `-f markdown+lhs` is a georgeous rendering of a .lhs file.
- utilises stack for a tight compilation loop, from initial code to rendered html, including computational results (via [pandoc-include](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-include)).
- Targets [github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) for immediate publication on `git push`.

The `app/example.lhs` is then a one-stop shop for links, ideas, app, tester and example holder.

compilation recipe
---

~~~
stack build --test --exec "$(stack path --local-install-root)/bin/readme-lhs-test-example" --exec "$(stack path --local-bin)/pandoc -f markdown+lhs -i app/example.lhs -t html -o index.html --filter pandoc-include --mathjax" --file-watch
~~~

The above `recipe`, taking advantage of stack composability, builds the project, runs the test, renders this file as html, and then watches for file changes.  Pandoc and pandoc-include are assumed to be installed via stack, so you might have to:

~~~
stack install pandoc
stack install pandoc-include
~~~

template
---

The bare bones of this process is available as a stack template:

~~~
stack new project-name readme-lhs
cd project-name
stack build
$(stack path --local-install-root)/bin/readme-lhs-example
~~~

The `other/readme-lhs.hsfiles` can always be edited, renamed etc and dropped into a directory, and stack will find it.
